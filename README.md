# Hello-World

This is a test repository to figure out how to use github.
Hello World, I've heard much about you but this surpasses all expectations. Sweet.


Here's what GitHub creates when 'base' and 'compare' have conflicting commits before merging the pull request:
#(conflict markers commented out)
#<<<<<<< readme-edits
I actually dreamt about GitHub last night, and how nice it would be to use this with EC_MS.
#=======
I'm editing directly in master, like a boss.
#>>>>>>> master
